								<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2><br>
								<header class="major">
									<p>During my internship at Cokonet Technologies, I identified inefficiencies in the organization’s business processes, specifically in data flow standardization and manual repetiton of tasks. These inefficiencies not only slowed down the workflow 
										but also consumed additional resources, such as my time, which could have been used for more strategic tasks. By analyzing the existing processes and identifying gaps, 
										I proposed two key recommendations: <b>Data Harmonization and Process Automation.</b> These solutions were aimed at improving workflow efficiency, enhancing data accuracy, and reducing manual intervention. Below,
										 I provide a detailed explanation of each recommendation, including the problem identified, the proposed solution, and the skills utilized to address it.</p>
								</header>
								<p><h2 style="text-align: center;">1. Data Harmonization</h2></p>
								<p><h3>Problem:</h3></p>
								<p>The organization faced challenges with inconsistent data flow due to fragmented data sources, including cloud platforms, APIs, and MySQL databases. 
									While an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process was already in place, the lack of a centralized repository meant that data integration was happening in silos, 
									leading to redundant processing efforts and delays in delivering harmonized data to downstream processes. This inefficiency hindered timely decision-making and created discrepancies in reporting.</p>
								<p><h3>Solution:</h3></p>
								<p>I recommended the implementation of a Data Warehouse as a centralized repository to consolidate data extracted through ETL processes. By standardizing the data integration pipeline and creating a single source 
									of truth, the organization could eliminate redundancies and streamline data access. The data warehouse would ensure that all departments received consistent, accurate, and harmonized data in real-time, 
									improving the quality and timeliness of reporting and analysis. This approach also enabled better scalability for future data demands, supporting more robust analytics and decision-making processes.
								</p>
								<p><h3>Skills Used:</h3></p>
								<p><b>1. Problem-Solving:</b>By identifying the lack of centralized storage as the root cause, I developed a scalable solution to streamline data flow and ensure consistency.<br>
									<b>2. Critical Thinking:</b>I assessed the limitations of siloed ETL processes and justified the need for a data warehouse, aligning it with the organization’s future growth and analytical requirements.<br>
									<b>3. Attention to Detail:</b> I analyzed the data flow in a detailed manner across systems to ensure the proposed data warehouse would seamlessly integrate with existing processes without incurring a consequential CTC.<br>
									<b>4. Communication:</b>I effectively presented the technical and operational benefits of the data warehouse to both technical teams and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring a clear understanding of its benefits and alignment with business objectives.
								</p>
								<p><h2 style="text-align: center;">2. Project Status Update Automation</h2></p>
								<p><h3>Problem:</h3></p>
								<p>The manual process of sending client update emails, often done by me, was time-consuming and prone to delays. This dependency on a single individual for such a critical task posed a risk to 
									timeliness and consistency in client communication, affecting the overall client experience.</p>
								<p><h3>Solution:</h3></p>
								<p>I recommended automating client update emails by introducing an automated email system triggered at key workflow milestones. This solution ensured that clients received timely and consistent updates without requiring manual intervention, 
									improving operational efficiency and allowing team members to focus on higher-value tasks.
								</p>
								<p><h3>Skills Used:</h3></p>
								<p><b>1. Problem-Solving:</b>I identified the inefficiency of manual email handling and designed an automated solution tailored to the workflow needs, ensuring timely updates for clients.<br>
									<b>2. Critical Thinking:</b>I understood the necessity of integrating the email automation process with the current milestone-setting workflow, recognizing that this would require the project manager's involvement. 
										I considered this interdependency and addressed it proactively when presenting the solution to the MD, ensuring the proposed solution accounted for and mitigated all potential future pain points.<br>
									<b>3. Attention to Detail:</b> I carefully reviewed the current milestone-setting process and mapped the precise points where email automation would need to be triggered. 
									This included identifying critical communication stages, ensuring that automated updates were relevant, accurate, and aligned with client expectations at each stage.<br>
									<b>4. Communication:</b>  I collaborated with the team to outline the automation's impact, demonstrating how it would reduce dependency on manual effort and improve client satisfaction.
